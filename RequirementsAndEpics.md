### Entry Subtasks:
 - As a student, I want to create smaller tasks that need to be completed for a large project so that I can stay on track while working on it.

 - As a user, I want to see all subtasks associated with a main task so I can see the bigger picture and plan my work accordingly.

### Password Encryption and User Data Storage:
 - As a student, I want my user information to be secure so I can not worry about my information getting stolen in the event of a data breach.

 - As a user, I want my password to be securely transmitted to the server when logging in so I can trust my login credentials are protected.

### Recurring Tasks:
 - As a student, I want to have the ability to set recurring tasks so that I can keep a routine of tasks that need to be repeated without actually having to manually go in and add them each time they need to be repeated.

 - As a user, I want to have the ability to set tasks to recur at whichever interval I choose; daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

 - As a user, I want to be able to set if a task should recur forever or if it should start at a certain date and end at a certain date.

 - As a user, I want to be able to have the ability to differentiate my recurring tasks from my regular ones.

 - As a user, I want the ability to be able to pause a recurring task and start it when I need it again.
