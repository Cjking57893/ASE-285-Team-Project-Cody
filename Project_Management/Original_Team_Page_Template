Requirements
Make your initial version, upload it to GitHub and make a link. If you make a revision, commit your changes and sync to GitHub, and relink the old version and the new version of your commit.

Start early and finish early, but you should also take time designing your features instead of diving into working on them. So, be sure to have the 1st version and keep revising it.
